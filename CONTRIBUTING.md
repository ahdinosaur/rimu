## Style Guide

### Git style guide

Write your commit messages however you want, at the end we will squash the commits as the pull request is merged.

When you submit a pull request, include clear information about how your pull request:

- What problem are you trying to solve? (Include references to relevant links)
- What is changed by this pull request:
  - Any breaking changes?
  - Any feature additions?
  - Any bug fixes?
- Document any and all technical decisions you had to make along the way.

If and when your pull request is merged, we will squash the commits into a single commit, where the commit message is your pull request text.

### Rust style guide

We follow the [Rust Style Guide](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/blob/master/guide/guide.md), enforced using [rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt).

To run rustfmt tests locally:

1. Use rustup to set rust toolchain.

2. Install the rustfmt and clippy by running

```shell
rustup component add rustfmt
rustup component add clippy
```

3. Run clippy using cargo from the root of your repo.

```shell
cargo clippy
```

Each Pull Request needs to compile without warning.

4. Run rustfmt using cargo from the root of your repo

To see changes that need to be made, run

```shell
cargo fmt --all -- --check
```

If all code is properly formatted (e.g. if you have not made any changes), this should run without error or output.

If your code needs to be reformatted, you will see a diff between your code and properly formatted code. If you see code here that you didn't make any changes to then you are probably running the wrong version of rustfmt.

Once you are ready to apply the formatting changes, run

```shell
cargo fmt --all
```

You won't see any output, but all your files will be corrected.

### JavaScript style guide

We follow the a JavaScript style similar to [Standard Style](https://standardjs.com/), enforced using [`prettier`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier). See `prettierrc.yml` for the Prettier configuration.

### Specs style guide

We use [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) for our specifications.

### Documentation style guide

We use [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) for our documentation.
