# Rimu blocks

Rimu is structured as blocks similar to [YAML](https://yaml.org/), with some important differences.

## Collections

### Objects

```yaml
mikey:
  name: "Mikey"
  website: "https://mikey.nz"
```

#### Keys

Keys must either be:

##### Unquoted Key

Unquoted keys are [identifiers](./expressions#Identifiers) and must conform to regex: `^[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*$`.

##### Quoted Key

Quoted keys can be any valid Unicode.

```yaml
"ðŸ™†": "okay!"
```

### Lists

```yaml
similar_projects:
  - JSON-e
  - Nickel
  - Jsonnet
```

## Scalars

Unlike YAML, scalars are expressions.

So this means Rimu is both more strict and more expressive:

- Strings must be wrapped in quotes, otherwise is assumed to be an identifier.
- No more implicit typing (aka the ["Norway Problem"](https://hitchdev.com/strictyaml/why/implicit-typing-removed/))

Before we go into expressions in more detail, here are the basic scalars, as similar to YAML.

### Null

```yaml
mikey: null
```

### Boolean

```yaml
nonsense: true
```

### Number

```yaml
bottles_of_beer_on_the_wall: 99
```

### String

```yaml
cat: "Charlie"
```

## Multi-line values
