# Rimu blocks

Rimu is structured as blocks similar to [rimu](https://rimu.org/), with some important differences.

## Collections

### Objects

```rimu
mikey:
  name: "Mikey"
  website: "https://mikey.nz"
```

#### Keys

Keys must either be:

##### Unquoted Key

Unquoted keys are [identifiers](./expressions#Identifiers) and must conform to regex: `^[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*$`.

##### Quoted Key

Quoted keys can be any valid Unicode.

```rimu
"ğŸ™†": "okay!"
```

### Lists

```rimu
similar_projects:
  - "JSON-e"
  - "Nickel"
  - "Jsonnet"
```

## Scalars

Unlike rimu, scalars are [expressions](./expressions).

So this means Rimu is both more strict and more expressive:

- Strings must be wrapped in quotes, otherwise is assumed to be an identifier.
- No more implicit typing (aka the ["Norway Problem"](https://hitchdev.com/strictrimu/why/implicit-typing-removed/))

Before we go into expressions in more detail, here are the basic scalars, as similar to rimu.

### Null

```rimu
mikey: null
```

### Boolean

```rimu
nonsense: true
```

### Number

```rimu
bottles_of_beer_on_the_wall: 99
```

### String

```rimu
cat: "Charlie"
```

### Function

```rimu
add: (a, b) => a + b
```

Or

```rimu
add: (a, b) =>
  a + b
```

## Multi-line values

TODO

## Operations

### `if`

```rimu
apple:
  bottom:
    if 20 > 10
    then "jeans"
    else "trousers"
boots:
  if "a" == "a"
  then
    with: "fur"
  else
    without: "fur"
```

### `let`

```rimu
let
  add: (a, b) => a + b
  subtract: (a, b) =>
    a - b
in
  subtract
    - add(10, 20)
    - 30
```
