# A Rimu Tutorial

Have you ever heard of turtle geometry?

[![(1983) Talking Turtle (for PBS)](https://tube.arthack.nz/static/thumbnails/4aa0b733-971c-417e-8613-da86fb268e83.jpg)](https://tube.arthack.nz/videos/watch/d976a246-dd20-4441-82fe-d7c687a33a78)

We could implement a Logo-inspired turtle game using Rimu, where kids could move turtles with code.

If we wanted to [make a star](https://www.turtleacademy.com/programs/40499):

```yaml
- setwidth: 10
- setcolor: 4

- right: 18
- forward: 50

- $map: range(5)
  each:
    - right: 144
    - forward: 50
    - left: 72
    - forward: 50
```

Then the output is a list of commands for the turtle to execute.

Now we might start to think about a better data model, how do we want users to describe their turtle actions?
