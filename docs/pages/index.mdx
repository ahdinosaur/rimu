    Data structure template language.

Rimu is a template language for structured data and functional expressions.

Unlike other template languages, Rimu operates on data structures, not text.

## Features

- Structured: The good parts of [Yaml](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML)
- Functional: The good parts of [Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language))
- Friendly: The good parts of [Logo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language))
- Lightweight embed: Able to be embedded into a web or native app
- Helpful to debug: Error messages let you know exactly what went wrong
- Safe with untrusted input: No arbitrary code execution or unbounded iterations

## Use cases

Rimu should be suitable for any situation where you want functional data or expressive configurations.

- Programmatic user: when you want to give users a friendly and expressive sandbox for making things with a DSL, almost like [Logo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)) or [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/).
- Programmatic configuration: when your infrastructure-as-code ([Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), [NixOps](https://github.com/NixOS/nixops)), declarative package managers ([Nix](https://nixos.org/)), or build systems ([Bazel](https://bazel.build/)) are complex enough to need functional config generation.

The author [Mikey](https://mikey.nz), for [Village Kit](https://villagekit.com), is motivated by the "programmatic user".

## Stability

The Rimu language is experimental.

If you need stability, see [related projects](./related).
