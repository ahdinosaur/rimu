    A data structure template language.
  </strong>
</div>

Rimu is a friendly template language for structured data and functional expressions.

Create parametric data using the best of Yaml structures and Lisp functions.

## ðŸŒ¿ Features

- **Structured**: Structured block and flow data of [Yaml](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML)
- **Functional**: Functional expressions of [Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language))
- **Educational** \*: Inspired by [Logo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)) to be accessible to beginner programmers.
- **Embeddable**: Lightweight embed into web or native apps
- **Debug-friendly** \*: Clear error messages when something is wrong
- **Secure:** Safe with untrusted input

\* _Work in progress_

## ðŸ’¡ Use Cases

Rimu enables user-friendly expressive [domain-specific languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language):

- **Programmatic users**: When you want to give users an expressive language for building things, like [Logo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)) or [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/).
- **Creative coding:** When you want to give artists and creators a playground for interactive and generative art.
- **Complex configs**: When your infrastructure-as-code ([Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), [NixOps](https://github.com/NixOS/nixops)), declarative package managers ([Nix](https://nixos.org/)), or build systems ([Bazel](https://bazel.build/)) are complex enough to need functional config generation.
- **Expressive configs**: When you want your system's configuration to be more expressive than static data.

## ðŸ“Œ Stability

The Rimu language is in the experimental phase.
