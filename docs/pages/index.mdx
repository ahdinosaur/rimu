Rimu is a template language for structured data and functional expressions.

Unlike other template languages, Rimu operates on data structures, not text.

## Features

- Structured: The good parts of Yaml
- Functional: The good parts of Lisp
- Lightweight: Able to embedded as WASM into a web page
- Friendly error messages: Lets you know exactly what went wrong
- Safe with untrusted input: No arbitrary code execution or unbounded iterations

## Use cases

Rimu should be suitable for any situation where you want functional data or expressive configurations.

- Programmatic user data: when you want to give users a friendly and expressive sandbox for making programmatic things, almost like [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/).
- Complex configurations: when your infrastructure-as-code ([Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), [NixOps](https://github.com/NixOS/nixops)), declarative package managers ([Nix](https://nixos.org/)), or build systems ([Bazel](https://bazel.build/)) are complex enough to need functional config generation.

The "programmatic user data" case is the motivating use case for the [author](https://mikey.nz), so this may inform future developments.
